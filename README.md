# ZiaBot

## About

This is a 100% Mobile-based bot for OSRS, built completely in python by Brandon Norsworthy.

## Installation

ADB Technically isn't a requirement because it is automatically in the repository but if you want a direct download you can [click here](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip).

To set up the script you also need to download **Python3** and **BlueStacks**

**BlueStacks Settings**
* First log into BlueStacks using the play store.
* Second go into the options and change the settings to **Resolution 960x540** and **DPI 240**
* The real resolution on your monitor is irrelevant so don't try just resizing the window that doesn't help with anything

After downloading navigate to the installation location of ZiaBot via Command Prompt and use the command `py shellinterpreter.py <count> <reset_camera>`
* <count> -> (1/9999) The number of times the script will be ran
* <reset_camera> -> (True/False) Whether or not you need your game set to the specific settings for the bot to work correctly on the first startup this will always need to be 'True'

## Currently Support

**Mining**
* South-West Varrock Iron Mine
